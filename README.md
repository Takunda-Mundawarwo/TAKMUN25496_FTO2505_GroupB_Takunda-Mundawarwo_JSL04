# JSL03: Console-based Task Manager

This project builds on the JSL02 project, adding a simple task management system where users can add up to three new tasks to an existing task array. A additional new feature is the implemementation of an unique, incremental ID for each of the tasks. Once 6 tasks are entered, the system displays the array containing all of the tasks as well as an array of all completed tasks in the console.
